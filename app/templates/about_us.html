    <p>
        PPTJet was founded with a simple but powerful mission: <strong>to eliminate the friction of presentation creation.</strong>
        We understand how time-consuming it can be to design, format, and structure slide decks from scratch.
        Whether you're a student racing a deadline, a busy professional managing internal updates, or a startup founder prepping a pitch, PPTJet helps you turn ideas into clean, structured presentations in seconds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our team combines the talents of educators, designers, and software engineers who believe that <em>great ideas shouldn’t be held back by design skills.</em>
        With AI at the core, PPTJet helps you skip the formatting and get straight to the point—making your workflow faster, simpler, and more productive.

    <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 font-semibold text-2xl">User-Centric Simplicity</h2>
    <p>
        We’ve interviewed hundreds of users—from university students to SaaS startup founders—and discovered they value <strong>speed, clarity, and structure</strong> above all else.
        Every product decision we make, from the layout themes to the export formats, is guided by those needs.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Automation Without Limitation</h2>
    <p>
        While we offer a curated set of four high-quality templates—Aesthetic, Vintage, Creative, and Simple—our real strength lies in the <strong>AI-generated content structure</strong> behind them.
        You’re not locked into a static template; you’re starting with a smart foundation you can customise and evolve after export.
        Focus on your message, not the mechanics.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 mb-4 font-semibold text-2xl">Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
        As we grow, we’re committed to delivering even more intuitive tools that empower creators of all kinds—from educators and marketers to solo founders and enterprise teams.
        PPTJet is more than a tool—<strong>it’s a smarter way to communicate ideas.</strong>
